## Coding JoeKooler
Hello ~ It's Joe this is probably the last time I postpone my portfolio idea that I've been thinking about it for a long time
I really like story telling and stuff, but you know that I'm too shy and scared of destructive criticism and negative stuff so I always keeping my logs on my personal social media accounts ... but I really think in-order to grow I need a feedback loop for my work so here I am my personal portfolio with the ability to post my logs here 
in the future I would probably make it sync. with Medium or something but anyway checkout my website just for fun ...

> Or if you're interested in hiring me don't be shy contact me at josephkoolerson@gmail.com

thanks for reading~
